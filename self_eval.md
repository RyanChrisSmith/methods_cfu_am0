# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods? Ruby methods make sense to me, I am enjoying all the built in ways to get things accomplished.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own? I believe it makes sense and should come in handy in the future.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
Is there a way to see the code of the method? To have a better understanding of how they work?
